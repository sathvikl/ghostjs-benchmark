You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\\n\\n\\n## Basic tagging\\n\\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.\\n\\nIf you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.\\n\\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.\\n\\n\\n## The primary tag\\n\\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports==\\n\\nIn this example, **News** is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.\\n\\n\\n## Private tags\\n\\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don\'t necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, #video==\\n\\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of `News`, and `Cycling` - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with `#video`.\\n\\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:\\n\\n```\\n{{#post}}\\n    {{#has tag=\\\"#video\\\"}}\\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\\n    {{else}}\\n        ...regular markup for a post...\\n    {{/has}}\\n{{/post}}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost\'s extensive [theme documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}','<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.</p>\n<p>It doesn\'t matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging\nposts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of\nrelated content.\n\nBasic tagging\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between\ncategories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News  and\nother posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content\nlisted on /tag/news/  and /tag/cycling/, respectively.\n\nIf you tag a post with both News  and  Cycling  - then it appears in both\nsections.\n\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you\nhave. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own\ncover images and meta data.\n\nThe primary tag\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can\nadd the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add\na bunch of related tags which are less important.\n\nNews, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports\n\nIn this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,\nbut the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their\nrespective archives.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don\'t\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost\'s extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].','https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg',0,0,'published',NULL,'public',NULL,NULL,'5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7','2017-11-10 00:05:01','1','2017-11-10 00:05:01','1','2017-11-10 00:05:05','1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('5a04ed2d663ac7403dd02035','43dc9071-16db-4e7d-b9fe-528090e7d471','Using the Ghost editor','the-editor','{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.

As a beacon, the Sort Benchmark is a constant reminder of the journey taken and work accomplished by pioneers in computer systems of how we got here.\\n\\nStarted in 1985 by Turing Award winner Jim Gray, the benchmark measures the advances in computer software and hardware systems, and it is one of the most challenging benchmarks for computer systems. Participants in the past typically built specialized software and even hardware (e.g. special network topology) to maximize their chances of winning.\\n\\nThe original benchmark, called Datamation Sort, in 1985 required competing systems to sort 100 MB of data as fast as possible, regardless of the hardware resources used. 100 MB fits easily in the smallest USB stick you can find today, but back in 1985, it was a big challenge. The 1985 winning entry took 980 seconds. By 2001, this number was reduced to 0.44 seconds! To make the benchmark challenging, Datamation Sort was deprecated and a new TeraSort benchmark was created in 1998, changing the data size to 1TB.\\n\\nIn 2009, the 100 TB GraySort benchmark was created in honor of Jim Gray. Yahoo won the 2013 record using a 2100-node Hadoop cluster, sorting 100 TB of data in 72 minutes.\\n\\nIn 2014, our team at Databricks entered the competition using a distributed program built on top of Spark. Our system sorted 100 TB of data in 23 minutes, using only 207 machines on EC2. That is to say, Spark sorted the same data 3X faster using 10X fewer resources than the 2013 Hadoop entry. In addition to winning the benchmark, we also sorted 1 PB of data in 4 hours using a similar setup and achieved near linear scalability.\\n\\nThis 2014 win set a milestone: it was the first time a combination of open source software and cloud computing won the benchmark. In the past, only well-funded organizations could compete in the sort benchmark, because participants would need to acquire a sizable, costly cluster. But with the rise of the public cloud, anybody can leverage the elasticity and accomplish what was once only possible in a handful of companies.\\nCloudSort Benchmark\\n\\nThe GraySort Benchmark measures the time it takes to sort 100 TB of data regardless of the hardware resources used. A well designed sorting system is relatively linearly scalable. Once an organization creates a linearly scalable system, the chance of winning then depends to a large degree on the amount of money the organization is willing to spend in acquiring hardware resources.\\n\\nTo mitigate this, the benchmark committee in 2014 created a new category called CloudSort. Unlike the GraySort which picks the winner based purely on time, CloudSort favors the entry with the lowest cost, measured by public cloud pricing. This benchmark effectively measures the efficiency, i.e. ratio of performance to cost, of the cloud architecture (combination of software stack, hardware stack, and tuning).\\n\\nThe spirit of the CloudSort is that it should be accessible enough that everyone can “play” at all scales, and let the best system win. In its inception year, the research team from the University of California, San Diego built a specialized sorting program called TritonSort and sorted 100 TB of data on Amazon EC2 for only $451. The system was so efficient that no one was able to challenge it even a year later.\\n\\nThat finally changed this week when our joint effort beat it and set the new CloudSort record.\\nA New Cloud Record\\n\\nDatabricks, together with Nanjing University and Alibaba, formed a team called NADSort to compete this year. NADSort ran on 394 ecs.n1.large nodes on the AliCloud, each equipped with an Intel Haswell E5-2680 v3 processor, 8 GB of memory, and 4×135 GB SSD Cloud Disk. The sorting program was based on Databricks’ 2014 GraySort record-setting entry and adapted for better efficiency. You can find the details of NADSort in this technical report.\\n\\nIn the previous record for CloudSort, it cost nearly five dollars ($4.51) per terabyte, to sort 100 terabytes of data. Our optimizations and the cloud have reduced the per terabyte cost by two-thirds, and our new record stands at $1.44 per terabyte!\\n\\nWhat made this cost efficiency improvement possible?\\n\\n> Cost-effectiveness of cloud computing: Increased competition among major cloud providers has lowered the cost of resources, making deploying applications in the cloud economically feasible and scalable. In addition, cloud computing also enables use cases that were simply not possible before with on-demand resources and elasticity.\\n\\n> Efficiency of software: We have invested heavily in performance optimizations, with some of the most significant changes in the last two years. Innovations such as Project Tungsten, Catalyst, and whole-stage code generation, have benefited Apache Spark enormously, improving all aspects of the stack. In addition to the general improvements in Spark, our collaborators have also worked on improving shuffle specifically for the AliCloud environment.\\n\\n> Expertise in optimizing Spark and cloud-native architecture: As the creators of Spark, we continue to lead the way in execution optimization. In addition, we have developed deep expertise in operating and tuning cloud-native data architecture by operating tens of thousands of clusters at once for our customers and users. The expertise we developed in building the most efficient cloud architecture for data processing enabled us to push the boundary of cost-efficiency in addition to the innovations from providers.\\n\\nSignificance of Sorting in Distributed Data Processing\\n\\nYou might ask: what’s the significance of sorting, and why would we sort so much data?\\n\\nAt the core of sorting is the shuffle operation, which moves data across all machines. Shuffle underpins almost all distributed data processing workloads. For example, a SQL query joining two disparate data sources uses shuffle to move tuples that should be joined together onto the same machine, and collaborative filtering algorithms such as ALS rely on shuffle to send user/product ratings and weights across the network.\\n\\nMost data pipelines start with a large amount of raw data, but as the pipeline progresses, the amount of data is reduced due to filtering out irrelevant data or more compact representation of intermediate data. A SQL query on 100 TB of raw input data most likely only shuffles a tiny fraction of the 100 TB across the network, and the query optimizer can be smart to reduce the amount of data scanned. This pattern is also reflected in the naming of MapReduce itself.\\n\\nWe evaluate Spark using a lot of different benchmarks, e.g. TPC-H, TPC-DS. The sort benchmark, however, is by far the most challenging due to the way it stresses the execution path. Sorting 100 TB of input data requires shuffling 100 TB of data across the network. We can’t hide behind clever tricks such as data skipping or query optimizations to reduce the scale.\\n\\nThe above attributes make sorting a metric we frequently refer to when we seek to measure and improve Spark.\\n\\nThe optimizations we did for our 2014 GraySort record have led to important improvements to Spark itself in the last 2 years: Netty-based network module to improve network throughput, off-heap memory management to remove GC, Project Tungsten to improve CPU efficiency. We have learned more with our 2016 CloudSort record, and we will apply those learnings to our development on Spark and the Databricks platform.\\n\\nThe achievements of two world records in two years leave us humbled, yet they validate the technology trends we’ve invested in heavily: Spark and cloud computing. These achievements are also testament to the engineering prowess we posses.
